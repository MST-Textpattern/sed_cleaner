# In your new installation, go to @admin > plugins@ and upload the plugin

h2(#cleanups). The @cleanups.php@ file...

This optional file allows you to define additional custom actions to be taken by sed_cleaner.

You can customise the cleanup actions to be taken by editing the file. Once you're happy with your cleanups file you should upload it to your site's @textpattern@ directory. If sed_cleaner finds this "scripting" file it will attempt to perform the additional cleanup actions defined in it.
